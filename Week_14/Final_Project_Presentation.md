# Final Project Presentation

You will have 10-12 minutes to present your final project to the class. Try to leave at least several minutes at the end of your presentation for questions and feedback.

Your presentation should include:

- The title of your project.
- A live demonstration of your project and/or video documentation of someone using your project.
- Why did you choose to make this project?
- What were your inspirations?
- Who did you make this project for?
- Did your project idea evolve over time? If so, how and why?
- How did you build your project? Dicuss this at a _high level_; don't show your entire codebase. Make sure to credit any external libraries and/or code that you adapted from other programmers.
- What would you do differently if you had to do this project again?
- How would you expand or improve on your project if you had additional time?
- What would you like feedback on?

These topics don't have to be addressed in the specified order.

Slides are required. Please practice your presentation at least once before class.

Avoid scrolling through your code during your presentation - it can be difficult for your audience to follow. If there's a specific part of your code that you want to highlight or explain, make a slide for it.

Please submit all of the necessary code and data for your project, as well as your presentation slides and any documentation that you've taken, as a single .zip file sent to me via a DM on Slack. If your project is hosted online somewhere, please also send me a link to it. This is due by 2:30pm on Monday, December 9th.
