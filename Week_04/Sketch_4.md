# Sketch #4: Generative Landscape

Write a program that presents an ever-changing, imaginative "landscape". Populate your landscape with features that are suitable for your concept: perhaps trees, buildings, vehicles, animals, people, food items, body parts, hairs, seaweed, space junk, zombies etc. Give consideration to the _depth of variation_ in your landscape: after how much time does your landscape become predictable? How could you forestall this as long as possible? How can you generate a landscape which is both consistent and engaging?

Consider: foreground, middleground, and background "layers"; variation at the macro-scale, meso-scale, and micro-scale; natural and human-made features; utopia, dystopia, and heterotopia; and the potential for _surprise_, through the placement of _infrequent_ features.

Your sketch must use **custom classes, arrays, and matrix transformations**.

Submit your sketch to [OpenProcessing](https://www.openprocessing.org/class/60310) under the `Generative Landscape` collection. Label your sketch with your name in the format `Firstname_Landscape`.
