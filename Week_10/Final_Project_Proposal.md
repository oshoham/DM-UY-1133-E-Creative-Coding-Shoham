# Final Project Proposal

Prepare a 3-5 minute presentation outlining a proposal for your final project.

The final is an opportunity for you to make a creative coding project entirely of your own choosing. You can use Processing or p5.js, and you're allowed to include other libraries. You have a little more than 3 weeks from the date of your proposal presentation to work on your final project.

You're allowed to collaborate in groups of 2 on your final project. If you choose to collaborate with another student, then both of you need to present your proposal, and your combined presentation should be 6-10 minutes long to reflect both of your contributions.

Your project proposal should include:

- A description of what you plan to create.
- Why did you choose this project? Is there a question that you’re trying to answer? Is there something that you’re commenting on or critiquing with your work?
- What are your inspirations?
- Who are you making the project for? How do you expect your audience to interact with your piece? What will their experience be like? Think about making a project intended just for you, or for a friend, or a small community. You don't have to make something intended for a general audience.
- How are you going to build it?  Be as specific as possible. What programming language are you going to use and why? What libraries might you use? The more you plan in advance the easier it will be to successfully produce.
- What's the title of your project?

 Slides are highly encouraged.
