// Variables are containers that store values. Each variable has a type,
// which tells Processing what kind of value it will hold.
//
// You declare a variable by writing a type and then a name for your variable,
// and then you can assign a value to your variable using the '=' operator:
// <type> <name> = <value>;
//
// These are some of the most commonly used data types in Processing:

int wholeNumber = 1; // integers store whole numbers
float decimalNumber = 0.5; // floats (short for floating-point numbers) store decimal numbers
boolean yes = true; // booleans store true/false values (these will become useful when we get to conditionals)
boolean no = false;
String sentence = "hello world!" // Strings store text, which can be written as a value inside a pair of quotation marks
