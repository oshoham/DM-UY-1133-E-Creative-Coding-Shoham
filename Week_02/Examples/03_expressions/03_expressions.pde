// Variables can hold expressions, which are a way of making a new value
// by combining other values with operators. Expressions can be a mix of values,
// math equations, and function calls.

// Here are some basic math operations available in Processing:
int five = 2 + 3; // addition
int negativeOne = 1 - 2; // subtraction
int twentyFive = 5 * 5; // multiplication
float oneHalf = 1 / 2.0 // division

// You can also pass expressions as arguments to function calls.
println(five * 2);

// When working with the division operator, it's important to note that
// you won't get fractional results unless one of the values in your equation
// is a float:

println(1 / 2) // 0
println(1 / 2.0) // 0.5
