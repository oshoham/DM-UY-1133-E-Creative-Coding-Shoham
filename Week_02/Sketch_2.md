# Sketch #2: Portrait

Spend at least 30 minutes drawing a portrait on paper. It might take several attempts. This portrait could be of you, a friend, your dog, etc. It does not have to prioritize realism over style.

Then, using shapes, lines, points and curves, take your paper portrait and reinterpret it in code. You may need to simplify and change it significantly. If you want to use curves, see [this tutorial](https://processing.org/tutorials/curves/) on curves for more assistance.

Submit your sketch to [OpenProcessing](https://www.openprocessing.org/class/60310) under the `Portrait` collection. Label your sketch with your name in the format `Firstname_Portrait`.
