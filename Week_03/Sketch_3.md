# Sketch #3: Visualizing Time

Create a non-standard clock using Processing. Your clock must "tell time" using a novel graphic concept. Think of creative ways to represent time and consider different types of time (lunar, geological, historical, biological, screen-time, etc.). Your sketch must include **loops and custom functions**.

Submit your sketch to [OpenProcessing](https://www.openprocessing.org/class/60310) under the `Visualizing Time` collection. Label your sketch with your name in the format `Firstname_Clock`.

If you're looking for inspiration, I highly recommend reading Golan Levin's lecture notes on [Representing Time](https://github.com/golanlevin/lectures/tree/master/lecture_clock).

If you're looking for a refresher on working with time in Processing, check out the Coding Train [Creating a Clock](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4RyStef-gY) tutorial (it's in p5.js rather than Processing, but the core programming concepts still apply).
