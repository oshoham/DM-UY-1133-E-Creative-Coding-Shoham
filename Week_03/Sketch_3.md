# Sketch #3: Visualizing Time

Create a non-standard clock using Processing. Your clock must "tell time" using a novel graphic concept. Think of creative ways to represent time and consider different types of time (lunar, geological, historical, biological, screen-time, etc.). You'll probably want to use Processing's [`hour()`](https://processing.org/reference/hour_.html), [`minute()`](https://processing.org/reference/minute_.html), [`second()`](https://processing.org/reference/second_.html), and [`millis()`](https://processing.org/reference/millis_.html) functions, but you're also welcome use [`day()`](https://processing.org/reference/day_.html) and [`month()`](https://processing.org/reference/month_.html) to make a clock that changes with the time of year. Your sketch must include **if statements** and **custom functions**.

Submit your sketch to [OpenProcessing](https://www.openprocessing.org/class/60310) under the `Visualizing Time` collection. Label your sketch with your name in the format `Firstname_Clock`.

If you're looking for inspiration, I highly recommend reading Golan Levin's lecture notes on [Representing Time](https://github.com/golanlevin/lectures/tree/master/lecture_clock). I'd also suggest looking at John Maeda's [12 o'clocks](http://cmuems.com/2016/60212/lectures/lecture-09-09b-clocks/maedas-clocks/), a collection of clock experiments.

If you're looking for a refresher on working with time in Processing, check out the Coding Train [Creating a Clock](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4RyStef-gY) tutorial (it's in p5.js rather than Processing, but the core programming concepts still apply).
